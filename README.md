# Phishing Detection System using Hybrid Machine Learning

This project detects phishing websites using URL-based features and a hybrid machine learning approach.
It combines multiple ML models to improve detection accuracy.

## Features
- Extracts URL features (length, domain, HTTPS, suspicious keywords, etc.)
- Trains Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM models
- Hybrid model for improved accuracy
- Predicts whether a URL is phishing or legitimate

## Tech Stack
- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
